# Models

## Model Structure
Models are able to be saved and loaded from the ```models/``` directory.  At this stage, only one model is included in this set. 

## Dataset Acknowledgements
This project leverages the following datasets, and a great thank you is extended to those that share Cybersecurity data.

* [NetLab 360's DGA Feed](https://data.netlab.360.com/dga/)  
Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.'s Security Lab, they graciously provide an open source feed of domains created with malware strains.  This feed is created by sifting through Passive DNS and provides some indication about the origins of the original domain.  

* [Andreweva's dgaDomains](https://github.com/andrewaeva/DGA)  
Developed for research, Andrew's responsitory contains a collection of the dga Algorithms for research purposes.  

* [Alexa Top 1 Million](https://www.alexa.com/)  
Alexa provides market research, search engine optimisation and key word analysis.  They generously offer details about the top 1 million websites ranked publicly.  This dataset was leveraged for a large number of benign domains.

### Note:
Many of these datasets and feeds are updated periodically, it may be worth replacing these files within the ```datasets/``` folder.  At this stage there has been no effort to determine the impact of new strains versus those that have already been trained. 

## Character Dictionary
* Character Dictionary was generated as part of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Types_of_URI_characters RFC 3986.  It is created by the use of the characters listed there.

## MaxFeatures
Should always be the size of the character dictionary.


## MaxLength
Attempted to do the following - resulted in lower accuracy and slower results due to its performance issues. 

Set to the length of the largest Token, we can hard code this knowing that the largest token will always be at most 253 characters from how the DNS system works.
